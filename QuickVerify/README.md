The main testing codes are in jupyter files.

For DL variant tests, it will generate E_k(x) and E_k(x \oplus \Delta) 
and test the probability of distinguishers with given masks.
Here we give several examples in 7-round Sepck32/64

The Neural Distinguishers in Section 4 can be found in ./NeuralD, 
and all testing files can be executed directly.
